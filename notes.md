# Notes

## Ideas

### Cat wand
Right click while looking at an entity = all tamed cats owned by player will attack target entity.
Shift right click on nearby block to summon a tamed cat (for easier testing, not balanced).


### Catnip
Feed catnip to a cat to temporarily improve health/armor/damage.
Grow catnip on tilled soil from... catnip seeds? Small chance to drop from tall grass? And some catnip plants added to world gen to give me a reason to work with that.
